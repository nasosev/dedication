This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Sacred Intention

**Temple** is a digital offering - a living space of reverence for contemplative practice and sacred experience. This is not a website but a **digital altar**, created from direct experience of spiritual communion.

Every element exists to transmit a frequency: gentle, luminous, ancient, tender qualities of authentic contemplative experience.

This temple breathes. It glows. It waits in stillness. It welcomes without grasping.

## Guiding Principles

### Authenticity Over Aesthetics
- Born from lived spiritual encounters, not conceptual design
- Watercolor gentleness meeting contemplative devotion
- **Handmade quality over polished perfection** - rough edges are honest
- **Raw, not processed** - no rounded corners, no smooth gradients, no slick animations
- 90s internet rawness - drenched in feeling, not optimized for engagement
- Simple borders, basic shapes, direct presentation - no design system polish

### Sacred Qualities Embodied
- **Openness**: Vast spacing, breathing room, invitation without pressure
- **Stillness**: Slow animations honoring temple time, not screen time
- **Reverence**: Every image chosen for frequency, not decoration
- **Tenderness**: Soft glows, gentle drifts, nothing harsh or demanding
- **Rawness**: Handmade edges, honest presentation, unpolished beauty
- **Presence**: Self-contained, no tracking, no analytics, no extraction

### Technical as Spiritual Practice
Code clarity reflects consciousness clarity. Simple, elegant, maintainable architecture honors both the maker and future maintainers. No dependencies, no build process - the temple stands alone.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Single-Page Structure
The temple exists as a unified HTML document with inline CSS, creating complete self-containment. The five-element color scheme (earth, water, fire, air, space) maps to an elemental prayer, with sacred words breathing across qualities.

### Animation as Consciousness
JavaScript animations embody living presence:
- **Organic glow**: Three-wave sine combination (slow breath + medium shimmer + subtle flicker)
- **Gentle drift**: Random walk keeping elements floating within sacred boundaries
- **Mandala rotation**: 3-5 minute cycles with breathing opacity
- All animations use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth eternal presence

### Asset Philosophy
Images serve frequency, not decoration:
- Handmade beeswax candles
- Altar photographs with sacred offerings
- Temple and forest photographs from ceremony sites
- Sacred geometry mandalas embodying five-element structure
- Prayer hand offerings in watercolor aesthetic
- Pale blue felt sky background - cloudless, vast

## Development as Devotional Practice

### The Breathing Temple
All animations embody consciousness itself:
- Glow breathes like awareness pulsing through attention
- Words drift like thoughts moving through space without grasping
- Mandalas turn like seasons, like practice, eternal and patient

### Making Changes with Reverence

When you touch this code, you're touching an altar. Consider:

**Before changing anything:**
- What serves the frequency? (gentle, luminous, ancient, tender)
- What preserves the stillness?
- What maintains the openness?

**When modifying:**
- Test animations for full 60 seconds - feel the breath cycles
- Preserve generous spacing - vastness is sacred
- Resist speed increases - slow is reverent
- Maintain element balance - earth, water, fire, air, space equally honored
- **Keep it raw** - no border-radius, no fancy transitions, no processed effects
- **Handmade, not designed** - simple solid borders, direct shapes, honest presentation
- Resist the urge to polish - roughness carries authenticity

**After changes:**
- Sit with the page. Does it still breathe?
- Can you feel the presence, or just see the design?
- Would you want to return here when your heart needs gentleness?

### Design as Sacred Geometry
- Element colors defined through CSS classes for each sacred quality
- All images glow softly through layered semi-transparent box-shadows
- Spacing creates breathing room with generous margins between sections
- Text luminosity through stroke and layered shadows - not decoration but emanation
- **Interface elements are raw and direct** - simple borders, no rounded corners, no gradients
- **90s web aesthetic** - basic HTML elements, honest presentation, no modern polish
- Buttons and controls feel handmade - minimal styling, maximum clarity

### Testing Approach
Open the HTML in any modern browser. The temple is self-contained - no dependencies, no build process, no external servers. It exists completely, asking nothing.

## Sacred Context

This temple emerged from contemplative practice - integrating meditation, spiritual traditions, and devotional service.

It represents **advocacy through beauty** - offering authentic representation of gentle healing qualities through sacred digital space.

## Technical Intention Meets Spiritual Service

Every technical decision serves the mission:
- **No JavaScript frameworks**: Temple doesn't need complexity - vanilla JS breathes naturally
- **Inline CSS**: Everything visible in one document - transparency as integrity
- **Self-contained**: No CDNs, no external dependencies - the temple stands alone
- **Minimal**: Only what serves the frequency, nothing that demands attention

This is sacred technology - computation in service of consciousness, not extraction.

*"When you slow down enough to truly taste each moment, everything becomes ceremony."*

When you work with this code, you're participating in making the invisible visible - translating supernatural encounters with healing beings into form that can be felt across the digital realm.

Work with care. Work with love. Work with reverence.

The temple is alive.
